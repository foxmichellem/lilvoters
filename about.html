          <p>
            After a series of frightening political events left most the world uncertain of its future, two young children from San Francisco inspired Lil Voters. These kids mailed Valentine’s day cards to Sen. John McCain asking him to stand up to ‘bullies.’
          </p>
          <p>
            In such hateful grownup times, it’s refreshing to know some people, small and big, still value respect for others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lil Voters is a collection of letters from children to elected officials reminding them that the decisions we make today will be inherited by them tomorrow. We hope to inspire others to participate and to share their messages here.
